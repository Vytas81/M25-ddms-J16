Programming for GIS and Remote Sensing Exercises

1. Getting started
To get started with the exercises, you'll need to install both git and conda on your computer. You can follow the instructions provided on Blackboard, or from the instructions for installing git from here, and Anaconda from here.

2. Create a conda environment

To do this, use the environment.yml file provided in the repository. If you have Anaconda Navigator installed, you can do this by selecting Import from the bottom of the Environments panel.

Otherwise, you can open a command prompt (on Windows, you may need to select an Anaconda command prompt). Navigate to the folder where you cloned this repository and run the following command:

C:\Users\iamdonovan> conda env create -f environment.yml
This will probably take some time, so feel free to catch up on Facebook or whatever kids do nowadays), but fortunately you will only have to do this once. 

3. Start jupyter-notebook
From Anaconda Navigator, you can launch jupyter-notebook directly, and navigate to the folder where the first week's practical material is located. Make sure that your environment is activated.

From the command-line, first open a terminal window or an Anaconda Prompt, and navigate to the folder where the first week's practical material is located.

Activate your newly-created environment. Launch jupyter-notebook (jupyter-notebook.exe), which should launch a web browser window, which should give you an overview of the current folder.
